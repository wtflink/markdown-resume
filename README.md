# markdown-resume

This is a simple resume site generator leveraging [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (GitHub Pages), and [github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css)

There's not much config currently.

Just modify the index.md and [set up GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)
