## Technical Experience

### Side Projects

- *[usb-lab](https://github.com/wtflink/usb-lab)* is a simple USB driver, which is mainly for my monitor built-in KVM feature, which can toggle through input source groups, allowing me switch through different device by simply submit a USB command. I found that there is no macOS version of the driver for the monitor. So I try to reverse engineer the monitor and get to know what is going on between the USB signals and the KVM feature. After all the work, I managed to develop a simple USB driver in Node.js, which is based on the [libusb](https://github.com/libusb/libusb) library.

Learning different points of view by thinking differently is one of the most precious experiences contributing to this project.
